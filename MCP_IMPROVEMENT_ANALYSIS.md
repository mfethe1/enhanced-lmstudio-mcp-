## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Optimization Recommendations

#### 1. Async Performance Timing
**Current Issue**: Using `time.time()` for async function timing
```python
# Current
start_time = time.time()
result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
execution_time = time.time() - start_time
```

**Improved Implementation**:
```python
# Improved - async-aware timing
start_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
execution_time = asyncio.get_event_loop().time() - start_time
```

#### 2. Structured Logging Enhancement
**Current Issue**: Basic logging configuration
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

**Improved Implementation**:
```python
# Structured JSON logging with multiple handlers
import structlog

logger = structlog.configure(
    processors=[
        structlog.stdlib.filter_by_level,
        structlog.stdlib.add_logger_name,
        structlog.stdlib.add_log_level,
        structlog.processors.JSONRenderer()
    ],
    wrapper_class=structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger,
    logger_factory=structlog.stdlib.LoggerFactory(),
    cache_logger_on_first_use=True,
)
```

#### 3. Dynamic Performance Thresholds
**Current Issue**: Fixed 0.2s threshold for all tools
**Solution**: Tool-specific performance thresholds
```python
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "sequential_thinking": 0.1,
    "analyze_code": 5.0,  # AI-powered tools need higher thresholds
    "suggest_improvements": 30.0,
    "file_operations": 0.2,
    "memory_operations": 0.1
}
