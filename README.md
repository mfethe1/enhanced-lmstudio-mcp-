## üõ† Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- LM Studio running locally (default: http://localhost:1234)
- DeepSeek R1 or compatible model loaded in LM Studio

### Quick Start
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables (optional):**
   ```bash
   export LM_STUDIO_URL="http://localhost:1234"
   export MODEL_NAME="deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b"
   ```

3. **Start the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

### Configuration Options
The server can be configured through environment variables:

- `LM_STUDIO_URL` - LM Studio API endpoint (default: http://localhost:1234)
- `MODEL_NAME` - Model name to use (default: deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b)


### MCP Manager (Augment) setup
- Command: `python`
- Args: `server.py`
- Working directory: `<project root>`
- Do not auto-start server at OS boot. Let the MCP manager spawn it so stdin/stdout pipes are wired correctly.

### Health check
- `health_check` supports a lightweight readiness probe. You can optionally pass `{ "probe_lm": true }` in arguments to ping the LM backend quickly.

### LLM tool flags
- `compact: true` to request shorter bullet lists and fewer tests
- `code_only: true` (generate_tests) to return only test code (we post-process to extract fenced code when present)

## üéØ Integration with Coding Agents

This enhanced MCP server is specifically designed to work with advanced coding agents that need:

### Iterative Problem Solving
- **Step-by-step reasoning** through complex technical challenges
- **Adaptive thinking** that can revise approaches based on new information
- **Context accumulation** across multiple interaction sessions

### Advanced Code Understanding

- **Real execution** capabilities for testing and validation
- **File system integration** for project-wide operations
- **Memory persistence** for learning and improvement over time

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Errors:**
- Ensure LM Studio is running on the configured port (default: 1234)
- Check that the model is loaded in LM Studio
- Verify network connectivity to LM Studio

**Execution Errors:**
- Ensure Python interpreter is available for code execution
- Check file permissions for temporary file creation
- Verify timeout settings for long-running operations

**Memory Issues:**
- Memory storage is in-process and will reset on server restart
- For persistent memory, consider implementing database storage
- Monitor memory usage with large datasets

### Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate timeout values for your use case
- Consider model-specific optimizations in LM Studio
- Monitor server resource usage during heavy operations

## üìà Version History
## ‚öñÔ∏è Safety Defaults (P0)

- ALLOWED_BASE_DIR: All filesystem tools are restricted to this base directory (default: current working directory). Set via environment variable.
- EXECUTION_ENABLED: Code and test execution tools are disabled by default. Enable by setting EXECUTION_ENABLED=true.
- Input validation: Tools now return JSON-RPC -32602 for invalid parameters (e.g., paths outside base dir).
- File search ignores heavy directories by default (e.g., .git, node_modules, venv, dist, build) and caps results.

### New/Updated Environment Variables
- ALLOWED_BASE_DIR: Absolute path to restrict file operations
- EXECUTION_ENABLED: true|false to gate code/test execution
- PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD: seconds for performance alerts (default 0.2)



### v2.0.0 (Current)
